<!---
Data: Tomato leaf disease detection 10 labels 11.000 sample (10k train & 1k test)

To test sequence & parallel, use smaller data with 3 labels, n_estimator = 10 & learning rate = 0.01

To test the overal result, use origin data with 10 labels, n_estimator = 300, learning rate = 0.3 & balance data function
